# Wildfires of the United States
# Group Members: 
Taylor Sullivan, Arpit Kumar, Sammy Hajomar, Joshua Vargas

# Summary:
Over the past 20 years, there has been a steady decrease in the number of wildfires in the United States. A profound finding is that increased spending is not positively correlated with wildfires’ area (measured by burned acres). Initial observations depict a growth in Private and Public procured funds to provide resources for preparing communities and combating fires. The public sector fund allocation follows linear growth, and the budget for the following fiscal year is predicted based on the trend. At the same time, private funding streams have steadily increased over the years. These varied amounts of public and private funding seemingly do not influence the amount of acres burned by a given fire after a given threshold. This concept demands further exploration and has inspired our project.

# Problem Statement: 

# Null hypothesis: 
There is no change to the extent of wildfires due to varying influxes of public and private assistance programs.

# Hypothesis: 
A proper distribution of public spending on wildfire suppression will reduce the area burned by a wildfire. 

# Central question: 
How much funding are we getting to prevent wildfires, and how much does each wildfire impact the United States’ GDP? Is that funding enough, and what is the ideal budget that can avoid growth wildfire once and for all? 


# Background, Scope, and Possible Solution: 
Our project analyzes the impact of forest fires on the economy and environment of the United States. We plan to represent this project in a narrative format, providing a visualization of a predictive model for forest fires in the next five years, followed by subsequent visualizations of each predicted forest fire’s financial and environmental impacts on the nation. 

Our project will consist of data gathered from the National Interagency Fire Center. It will involve a side-by-side comparison of human-caused and lightning-caused fires charted against the cost of suppression from the years 1985 - 2019. This will allow the user to compare environmentally-caused forest fires with human-impact. These visualizations will be accompanied by amplifying statistical information gathered from a variety of sources. 

Our presentation will conclude with a final interactive visualization that allows the user to explore the data themselves by selecting the area of a potential forest fire on the map and watching corresponding financial and environmental impact in a linked visualization.

The layout of the interactive article

An interactive article that begins with demonstrating the impact of forest fires on the US economy or environment or any other relevant factor. Later, we will delve deeper into state-wise forest fires (numbers and area) and the funding amount each state is receiving. Any correlation between them also if funding depends on the type of fire or fire fighting done by an agency. 

The article will discuss if fires by human activity are reduced to zero and how much money the country can save. If the fire extends by a day, how much extra money has to be spent per acre. 

Data source used and what data has been collected, and what data is pending.
